# AlphaCare-Insurance-Solutions

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze historical car insurance data to optimize the marketing strategy. The analysis focuses on understanding customer segments, trends in premiums and claims, and geographic patterns. By identifying low-risk customers, the company can target its marketing efforts more effectively.
Project Overview
his project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), univariate and bivariate analysis, and investigating trends over time and geography. The project leverages statistical methods and visualizations to generate insights that can drive business decisions

## Key Objectives

     
-Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the car insurance dataset.
-Identify key trends in insurance premiums and claims.
-Explore relationships between customer demographics (such as location, gender, etc.) and insurance policies.
-Optimize marketing strategy by targeting low-risk customers.

## Dataset

-Source: The dataset consists of car insurance data, including details about policies, premiums, claims, vehicle make and model, customer demographics, and geographical information.

-Size: 1,000,098 rows  rows and 52 columns.

### Key Columns are based on:

- Columns about the insurance policy

- The transaction date

- Columns about the client location he client

- Columns about the car insured

- Columns about the plan

- Columns about the payment & claim
